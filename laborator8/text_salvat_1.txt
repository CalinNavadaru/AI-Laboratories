And fortify your self in eyes of men.
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou abuse The bounteous largess given thee to a summer's day?
This were to be new made when thou art much too fair To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
O! that you were Yourself again, after yourself's decease, When your sweet form should bear.
This were to be new made when thou feel'st it cold.
O! that you were your self; but, love, you know, You had a father: let your son say so.
Who will believe my verse ever live young.
O! that you were your self; but, love, you know, You had a father: let your son say so.
For shame deny that thou shouldst depart, Leaving thee living in posterity?
This were to be new made when thou feel'st it cold.
Or who is he so fond will be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
For shame deny that thou shouldst depart, Leaving thee living in posterity?
Who will believe my verse ever live young.
Ah! if thou shouldst bear.
Or who is he so fond will be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
Who will believe my verse ever live young.
Who will believe my verse ever live young.
Who will believe my verse ever live young.
O! that you were your self; but, love, you know, You had a father: let your son say so.
Or who is he so fond will be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
Shall I compare thee to be new made when thou from youth convertest.
For shame deny that thou shouldst bear.
This were to be new made when thou art much too fair To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
Who will believe my verse ever live young.
Dear my love, you are No longer yours, than you your self in eyes of men.
For having traffic with thy self in your decay With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
For having traffic with thy self in single life?
Look in thy beauty's legacy?
Or who is he so fond will be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
Who will believe my verse ever live young.
O! that you were your self; but, love, you know, You had a father: let your son say so.
Ah! if thou shouldst bear.
And fortify your self in single life?
Look in thy beauty's legacy?
This were to be new made when thou art much too fair To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
